    <p>I find that most new music <s>isn’t very good</s> is wildly overrated, so I wanted to start writing about tracks that I love regardless of when they came out. Every month I will feature ten tracks that are present in my life at that given moment. Most of them will be old, but there will be a new one here and there. Most of these I own on vinyl, because I enjoy supporting the music industry where I can. If you have a few minutes, please give these a listen. I have provided links to purchase where applicable, because hopefully you want to keep artists, labels, and record stores in business as well, so that they can exist forever. I would really hate to know a world without them in it.

      <br>
      One night I was sitting on the couch and my wife showed me this video of bats standing upright, walking around, goth dancing about. This was the soundtrack. I know it's a lame way to discover new music - reminds me when you would see a video on <em>Bevis and Butthead</em> that you never heard before and there's no way you could tell your friends that's how you discovered it there...but they knew, trust me. Sometimes the journey is irrelevant, just as long as you get there. I'm now obsessed with this track (and entire record), another gem reissued by Sacred Bones. Want more? Check out their standout Black Sabbath <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5k5PmJ1APTCnbgbAlFab06?si=8f6wZ1S0SauijsAKnDJeOg">'Heaven and Hell’</a>cover.</p>

      <br>
      This is the opening track from the <em>CYBER DREAM</em> mix, I discovered when <a href="http://www.tstout.com/">Tyler Stout</a>, posted it on his blog.  I don’t know anything about this band or Smooth Sounds (made this mix, I think?) but if you’re in need of some chillwave/synthwave, and who isn’t once in a while, this is it.

    <br>
    Teenage Fanclub are as good as it gets when it comes to power pop alt rock. They are in fact still putting out records, but I stick to the core three that came out in the 90s: <em>Bandwagonesque, Thirteen,</em> and <em>Grand Prix</em>. To be honest, I didn’t care much about these guys back in the day, which to me makes me feel like they are underrated. The sudden revisit came when I did a rewatch the other day of <em>The World’s End</em>, which was much better than I had remembered. The whole soundtrack is amazing.

    <br>
    I had several friends recommend this band to me, and it made me think that I need to be keeping a better eye on Dias Records (Cold Cave, Cold Showers, Drab Majesty, Iceage, Xeno & Oaklander). On the surface this shouldn’t be anything but mediocre - violin player (ok Yellowcard), some members from Ceremony (yawn), and compare themselves to Jawbreaker in their bio (really...c'mon). I couldn't have been more wrong, this is the best 25 mins of the year, top five for sure. The whole record is solid, short and concise, guitar-driven indie pop at it’s best. It was hard to choose just one song, so go and listen to all of them. I don’t buy very many new records from newer bands anymore, but this was an insta-buy.

    The fathers of grindcore covering Sonic Youth. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Napalm Death and would probably skip Sonic Youth's ‘White Kross’ if it came on, but this combination is just right.

    <br>
    Growing up I was a fan of the Deftones and for some reason I just stopped paying attention. Don’t know if it was just the music I was into at the time, or the whole nu-metal label, but they have a lot of records that I missed out on, and they are all good. As I was catching up, making up for lost time, I came across this Smiths cover and it’s great, who knew? Chino Moreno rules, can’t wait for their new record.

    <br>
    I discovered the genius that is CZARFACE digging through the new arrivals bin at the Princeton Record exchange and the cover caught my eye. I had no idea what I was holding my hand was Inspectah Deck, 7L, & Esoteric - and this track with Method Man is untouchable. No one covers/reviews/cares about Czarface for some reason, but this destroys about 99% of today’s hip hop that people are talking about.

    <br>
    While I’m waiting to get my <a href="https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/product/inlet">vinyl copy of Hum’s new record <em>Inlet</em></a> (easily the best record of the year so far), revisit this stand out from their third record <em>You’d Prefer An Astronaut</em>. Not only does this track/album/band hold up, I’m always inpressed when a 90’s band puts out a record 20 years later and it’s actually good...not an easy thing to do.

    I’ve always loved Cibo Matto, just about everything they touched back in the day was cool - Butter 08, Miho’s feature on Handsome Boy Modeling School’s <em>So… How’s Your Girl?</em>, and this track was also a standout on the ‘Kids In the Hall Brain Candy (Matador super soundtrack)’. This track is as fresh as it was when it came out in 1996.

    <br>
    Danger Mouse. MF Doom. Adult Swim character voice samples. 2005. It’s a coin toss, this could be really good or really bad.  And when this came out I would only listen to the non-album remix of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2SKXt7F3D4B1l2e2UVBmLD?si=X0Bxo07hTw-qYGbD2eIqVg">'Sofa King’</a>, because that one hits hard. It only took me fifteen years to revisit this in it entirety and I need to remember the most important part of that equation: MF Doom. This is also Danger Mouse's beats and production at the top of its game, plus there’s a feature from prime Talib Kweli. This song is standout on a record full of standouts.
